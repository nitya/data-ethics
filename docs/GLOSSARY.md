### `A`

#### Anonymization

Data Anonymization is a [type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization). It's about removing [PID](#PID)(Personally Identifiable Information) from data sets so that the people (whom the data describes) remain anonymous. 

Also see: [De-identification](#De-Identification).

### `B`

#### Bias

---
### `C`

#### Consent

---
### `D`

#### Data Science Lifecycle

#### De-Anonymization

See [Re-identification](#re-identification).


#### De-Identification

[De-identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification) is the process used to prevent someone's personal identity from being revealed. Ex: removing name, date of birth and other personal or quasi-personal identifiers. When applied to metadata (_general data about identification_) it is also known as anonymization. The reverse process is called re-identification.

### `E`

#### Ethics

#### Ethical AI
See [Responsible AI](#responsible-ai)

### `F`

#### Fairlearn

#### Fairness

#### FAT/ML

### `I`

#### Intellectual Property

Intellectual property is defined as ["intangible property that is the result of creativity"](https://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2019/global/big-data-and-issues-and-opportunities-ip-rights). Intellectual property rights grant the holder a monopoly on the use of that creation for a specified period (subject to some exceptions)Data collection assets (items or datasets) may fall within the protection of intellectual property rights such as copyright, trade secrets, and database rights - **based on the jurisdiction**. 

Data scientists and organizations need to ask: _who owns the input data (raw) and who owns the output data (analysis) in big data workflows?_  

---
### `M`

#### Misrepresentation

Misrepresentation of data is about [communicating honestly reported data in a dishonest or deceptive manner](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/misrepresentation) - e.g., by using statistical techniques to manipulate results, drawing unwarranted inferences or creating misleading visualizations.

---
### `O`

#### Ownership

Data Ownership is the [act of having legal rights and complete control over a single piece or set of data elements](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29059/data-ownership). It defines and provides information about the rightful owner of data assets and the acquisition, use and distribution policy implemented by the data owner. **It is primarily a data governance process.**

---
### `P`

#### Privacy

[Data Privacy focuses on](https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-data-privacy/) **the rights of individuals** (e.g., to be left alone), the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences, **and the way organizations govern personal data** of data subjects. It focuses on how to collect, process, share, archive, and delete the data **in accordance with the law**.

Also see: [Data Security](#Security)

#### Pseudonymization

[Pseudonymization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification#Pseudonymization) is a de-identification strategy that is replaces real names with a temporary ID. It removes clearly identifiable information while allowing correlated information to be tracked over time. It cannot prevent de-identification if there are sufficient combinations of attributes that indirectly identify a unique user.


---
### `R`

#### Re-Identification

[Re-identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_re-identification), or _de-anonymization_, is the practice of matching anonymized data with publicly identifiable information (or auxiliary data) in order to reveal or discover the individual to whom that data belongs.

It is harder to prevent (especially in big data contexts) because companies may successfuly anonymize datasets they own, but can have those de-anonymized when combined with a different dataset (e.g., from a different entity they don't control) with simple data processing techniques applied.

### `S`

#### Security

By contrast [data security is about]((https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-data-privacy/)) a set of **standards and different safeguards and measures** that an organization is taking in order to prevent any third party from **unauthorized access to digital data**, or any intentional or unintentional alteration, deletion or disclosure of data.
