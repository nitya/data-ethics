## 9. Initial Roadmap

[Back to TOC](/?id=table-of-contents)

The initial goal was to explore data ethics topics and sub-topics using this roadmap - created from this [Markdown Gist](https://gist.github.com/nitya/2a5aab211f51c99eb64600ac0e30c087) using the online [markmap generator](https://markmap.js.org/repl). Click on the link below to see the visualization of the roadmap - or use the [Markmap VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode) and use it to view the [markmap.md](markmap.md) file in this repo. Markmaps can be downloaded as SVG or interactive HTML for convenience.
