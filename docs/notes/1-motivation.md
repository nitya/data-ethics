## 1. Motivation 

[Back to TOC](/?id=table-of-contents)

### 1.1 Trends in Big Data

We are all data citizens living in a datafied world. 
 * [By 2022](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/) one-in-three large organizations will buy and sell data via online Marketplaces and Exchanges.
 * [By 2025](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) we'll be creating and consuming over 180 zettabytes of data. 

**Data scientists** will have unimaginable levels of access to personal and behavioral data, helping them develop the algorithms to fuel an AI-driven economy. **App developers** will find it easier and cheaper to integrate AI into everday consumer experiences, thanks to the economies of scale and efficiencies of distribution in centralized exchanges. AI will become more ubiquitous in society.

### 1.2 Weaponization of AI

The benefits of decision-making AI (for automation, intelligence, personalization) need to be weighed against the potential harms and unintended consequences of its usage at scale. In [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHs8SA1qpk), Cathy O'Neil discusses _three elements_ that can weaponize AI, posing a danger to society at large:

 * `Opacity` | refers to the **black box nature** of many algorithms. _Can we explain why AI made a particular decision, or interpret the data reasoning behind its predictions_
 * `Scale` | refers to the **speed and ease** with which algorithms are adopted. _Can minor design flaws now get baked in and amplified quickly across industries, causing potentially irreversible harms to users?_
 * `Damage` | refers to the **societal consequences** of poor decision-making. _Can bad data or models lead to unfair algorithms or misrepresentations that disproportionately harm specific users or groups?_

### 1.3 The Need for Ethics

With great (data) power comes great (ethics) responsibility.  


[Democratization and industrialization of AI](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/) are the new Gartner Hype Cycle **megatrends** for big data and AI. Democratization speeds up adoption while industrialization motivates governance. Data ethics becomes crtical to both - providing guardrails to prevent weaponization of algorithms, and recommendations to influence regulatory policies. The rest of this lessons looks at data ethics from two perspectives:

 * Core Concepts = understanding ethics challenges and moral questions for big data
 * Applied Ethics = identifying principles and practices that establish a data ethics culture
