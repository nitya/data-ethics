## 7. Data Ethics Culture

[Back to TOC](/?id=table-of-contents)

Let's wrap up what we've learned so far:

Data ethics is about doing the right thing by establishing shared values and defining moral principles around data collection & usage, and algorithm design & deployment. Data ethics is motivated by trends in AI democratization and industrializaton of AI, and concerns around harms from _weaponization of AI_.

Data ethics challenges can be explored at two levels: _personal data_ and _AI algorithms_. The first focuses on individual rights and protections for data security and privacy. The second focuses on issues like data validity, algorithm fairness, and misrepresentation with potential harms at individual and collective levels.

In _Harms & Consequences_ we explored the potential harms to society from algorithms that are opaque, scalable and capable of damage at social and economic levels. While _Case Studies_ helped us understand the real-world implications of ethical lapses or violations.

In _Applied Ethics_ we looked at how we can implement ethical principles and practices in our own teams, organizations, and workflows. And we looked at _governance_ (from responsible AI frameworks, to professional codes of conduct, and government regulations) that help companies operationalize these learnings and make their members accountable for compliance.

But there remains an intangible gap between compliance ("doing enough to meet the letter of the law") and addressing systemic issues (like ossification, information asymmetry and distributional unfairness) that can create self-fulfilling feedback loops to weaponizes AI further. This is motivating calls for [formalizing data ethics cultures](https://www.codeforamerica.org/news/formalizing-an-ethical-data-culture/) in organizations, where everyone is empowered to [pull the Andon cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing) to raise ethics concerns early. And exploring [collaborative approaches to defining this culture](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-ai-ethics-requires-a-culture-driven-approach-26f451afa29f) that build emotional connections and consistent beliefs across organizations and industries.
