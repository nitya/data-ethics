## 3. Ethics Challenges

[Back to TOC](/?id=table-of-contents)

For simplicity, let's think about data ethics from two perspectives:
 * _Ethics of personal data_ - what are the issues in collecting and using **personally-identifiable information**?
 * _Ethics of AI algorithms_ - what are the issues in using big data to power **decision-making algorithms**?


### 3.1 Personal Data

[Personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) or personally-identifiable information (PII) is any data that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. It [can also extend](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en) to diverse pieces of non-personal data that collectively can lead to the identification of a specific individual. _Examples include:_ participant data from research studies, social media interactions, mobile & web app data, online commerce transactions and more. 

Ethical challenges (and moral questions) include:
 
  * **Data Ownership.** Who owns the data - user or  organization? How does this impact users' rights?
  * **Informed Consent.** Did users give permissions for data capture? Did they understand purpose & usage?
  * **Intellectual Property.** Does data have economic value? What are the users' rights in context?
  * **Data Privacy.** Is data secured from hacks/leaks? Is anonymity preserved on data use or sharing?
  * **Right to be Forgotten.** Can user request their data be deleted or removed to reclaim privacy?


### 3.2 AI Algorithms

Now let's think about data from multiple individuals and systems, collected and analyzed for creating data models and AI algorithms. Datasets will likely be curated for the target purpose, with the feature selection potentially including personal data attributes. 

Ethical challenges (and moral questions) now include:

 * **Dataset Bias** - Is data representative of target audience? Have we checked for different types of bias?
 * **Data Validity** - Did we select the right attributes and metrics for evaluating algorithm performance? 
 * **Algorithm Fairness** - Did we test model accuracy against different groups? Was model discriminatory?
 * **Misrepresentation** - Did visualizations and insights represent underyling data or analysis honestly?
 * **Explainability** - Can we explain algorithm decisions in user-friendly terms? Can we justify choices?
 * **Free Choice** - Did user exercise free will or did algorithm nudge them towards a desired outcome?
